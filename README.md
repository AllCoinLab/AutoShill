# DISCLAIMER
This is made for the shillers to shill more effectively and efficiently.  
If you use too much in too much TG groups with too much accounts,
it may lead unexpected results by the TG system. (ex. mute / ban)  
This tool is tested with many situations.  
(Up to 700+ groups for 300+ hours)  
But it may differ because of the various slow mode cooldown for each group  
regard many environment / situation of your account / computer

This tool has some safety methods to avoid it,  
but this is not responsible for those unexpected results.  
It is up to **YOU** to adjust using time and target group counts to avoid it.
